This is the arduino program running ont he maze solver project viewed in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1690543
You need the PID_v1 library fot arduino to make irt run

This is a current working project. It's a 3D printed Maze Solver and Line Follower based on the Pololu 3Pi robot.
It uses a Arduino Leonardo and a custom made shield.
